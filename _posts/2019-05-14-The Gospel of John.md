_Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and the shall call his name **Immanuel.**_

Matthew 1: 23

The book of Matthew is the very first book in the new testament, which starts right from the birth of our living Christ. Since my childhood, the first chapter has certainly been about the 14 generations of David and the genealogy behind Christ's birth and how Mother Mary bears a child when virgin. But, now that I closely introspect it, it has a message for all of us in a very unusual but subtle way.

Mary bore a child through the spirit of God, but in our ways, it's kind of hard to believe it. Similarly, Joseph too, was skeptical but a good man. He decided to leave Mary quietly without letting anyone know, so that her image isn't tarnished. Well, as we all know, you may not be able to put it in words; but he reads through your heart.
