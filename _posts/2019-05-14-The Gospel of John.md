_Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way, the voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight' 
Mark 1:2,3_

How subtly, John introduces our Savior with this paraphrase. He further exemplifies the greatness of the Christ and specifies how the love of Christ is.
