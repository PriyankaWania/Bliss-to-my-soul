_Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and the shall call his name **Immanuel.**_

Matthew 1: 23

The book of Matthew is the very first book in the new testament, which starts right from the birth of our living Christ. Since my childhood, the first chapter has certainly been about the 14 generations of David and the genealogy behind Christ's birth and how Mother Mary bears a child when virgin. But, now that I closely introspect it, it has a message for all of us in a very unusual but subtle way.

Mary bore a child through the spirit of God, but in our ways, it's kind of hard to believe it. Similarly, Joseph too, was skeptical but a good man. He decided to leave Mary quietly without letting anyone know, so that her image isn't tarnished. Well, as we all know, you may not be able to put it in words; but he reads through your heart. When Joseph was thinking about this, the angel of the God appeared in his dream and asked him to not be skeptical about Mary bearing a child because the child was through the spirit of the Lord. The angel asks him to marry Mary and name the child as Jesus.

In all of this, surely the birth of Christ is a great news for us. But, while reading through the scripture, the part where Joseph questions Mary is something that intrigued me. We all have a very fast-paced lifestyle with lots of ups and downs. To survive the need of the current generation, we have to be competitive. But, in this competition, or this lifestyle how many of us get questioned for something we aren't even responsible for? How many of us get judged for no reason?

This phase of self-doubt and mocking slowly starts attacking you emotionally, forcing you to question yourself and ultimately leading to depression. I have no clue whether or not anyone will ever read this, but if you do, trust me you are worthy of much more than this. You don't have to question yourself for what other's may have an opinion for you. Because, in the end, all that matters is what HE thinks about you. And frankly speaking, HE doesn't care about what others think because you are much more precious to Him that anything else. Here, in the scripture too, Mary was questioned. But, in the end, when God took a stand for her, Joseph had the choice of not believing and walking away also. But, he chose to stay. 

In the end, everything that is meant to be will surely happen. Other people's opinion don't really make you who you are. You know what you have gone through and not the other people who comment on you. All you can do, is dust yourself, and believe in the good in you. Because, in the end, it is this good in you that is going to make you stand against everything. God loves you no matter what, and no one's opinion is going to change that!

So, in the end, just be yourself, and rest leave it in the righteous hands of God!
